# Utility.TypeScript
[![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/jktoiuhito/utility.typescript/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/jktoiuhito/utility.typescript)

This is a collection of helper classes and methods I've found to be useful in TypeScript/JavaScript-based projects.

Current offerings include:
* Asserting that a value is or is not a basic type or null, and throwing if the assertation fails.
* ObservableList (Todo! Needs testing).

## Requirements

Lowest working version of TypeScript needed to compile the source code is unknown.

The compiled JavaScript targets and uses the module system defined in `ES6`.

## Installation

Todo! (no packages are yet published)

## Usage

Todo!
